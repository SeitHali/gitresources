Git Resources for Windows
=========================

This is a simple website that lists some helpful resources for using
Git on Windows, including links to guides for using Git and links to
tools for Windows.

This also serves as a simple example of a Git repository containing
an ASP.NET application!

If there's helpful information that you think should be listed here,
please contact Edward Thomson at ethomson@edwardthomson.com - or open
a pull request at https://github.com/ethomson/gitresources.
